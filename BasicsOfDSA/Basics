Basic Types of DataStructures: 
1. Abstract Data Structure:
    - Linked Lists 
    - Graph 
    - tree
    - Stack
    - Queue

Anything that stores data is called Data Structure. 
2. Primitive Data Structure
    - int 
    - Float 
    - bool
    - char

Characteristics of Data Structures:
1. Linear: Arranged in a linear sequence i.e. array
2. Non-Linear: Data items are not in a sequence i.e. Tree, Graph
3. Homogeneous: All elements are of same types i.e. Array 
4. Non-Homogeneous: The elements may or may not be a same type i.e. Structures
5. Static: whose sizes and structures associated memory locations are fixed, at compile time. i.e. Array
6. Dynamic: hich expands or shrinks depending upon the program need and its execution. Also, their associated memory locations changes. i.e. LinkedList Created using Pointers


Space and Time Complexity: 
--------------------------

1. Space Complexity: An amount of memory space required by an Algorithm
    Algorithm generally required space for following components:
        - Instruction Space: Its the space required to store the executable version of the program. 
                             This space is fixed, but varies depending upon the number of lines of code in the program.
        - Data Space: Its the space required to store all the constants and variables(including temporary variables) value.
        - Environment Space: Its the space required to store the environment information needed to resume the suspended function.
        
2. Time Complexity: Time Complexity is a way to represent the amount of time required by the program to run till its completion.
